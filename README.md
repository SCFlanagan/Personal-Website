# Personal Website

My personal portfolio of projects and contact and other information. I took this project as an opportunity to have some fun with the front end. I played around with CSS animations and achieved the neon lights effect using a combination of box-shadow, text-shadow and photoshop. This was a solo project.

Built using JavaScript, HTML, & SASS.
